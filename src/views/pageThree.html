        <p class="p-article">The Champions Chess Tour consists of six events, culminating in a Playoff and the Finals. The 2023 ChessKid Cup is the third event of the tour, and the winner of this event automatically qualifies for the Playoffs.</p>
        <p class="p-article">The event begins with a qualifying phase that is open to all non-grandmaster titled players. The successful qualifiers will then compete with grandmasters in the Play-in stage, with the top players moving on to a Knockout stage that has three divisions. Each division has its own prize fund, and players will also earn Tour Points based on their placement within each division. By the end of the tour's sixth event, the players with the highest Tour Points will earn a spot in the CCT Playoff.</p>
